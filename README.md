# Hermes-Relay

Hermes Relay is a lightweight automation project that curates high-impact cybersecurity news and distills it into concise, executive-relevant insights.

The goal is simple:
surface the stories that matter, extract the signal, and remove the noise.

## What It Does
- Aggregates cybersecurity news from trusted RSS sources
- Identifies stories with high operational, financial, or reputational impact
- Generates short, human-readable summaries and commentary
- Outputs daily briefings ready for sharing (e.g., LinkedIn, internal notes)

## Why It Exists
Cybersecurity news is abundant but unfocused.  
Hermes Signal is designed to prioritize relevance, consequence, and decision-making impact.

## Workflow
1. Pull articles from selected RSS feeds
2. Filter for material impact (breaches, threat actors, regulatory action)
3. Generate concise summaries and perspective
4. Output a daily markdown briefing

## Tech Stack (Initial)
- RSS feeds (public sources)
- Python or Node.js
- GitHub Actions (scheduled runs)
- Markdown outputs
- LLM-assisted summarization

## Status
Early-stage. Iterative by design.

## Philosophy
Less content. More signal.  
Clarity over volume.  
Human judgment first, automation second.
